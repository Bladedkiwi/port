			11/2/2020, 11:27:56 AM--<h2>Nifty Form Input</h3>
			<div class="note__content">
				<p>I found this nifty form for submitting your credit card number for payment. The actual input area for
					the card number is rather complex for how simplistic it feels.</p> <img
					 src="img/niftyCCardExample.png"
					 alt="Credit Card Input Field Example">
				<p style="grid-column: span 2;">When focusing on the input, the text in the background does not disappear like placeholder text, and
					will show a picture of the card type to the left of your number after placing it in. In fact, at
					first glance, I assumed the card number was all they were looking for because I had ignored the text
					on the right side of it. That's a nice feature to include the entire card info on one line, instead
					of the normal broken up fields. I can imagine someone would miss it, and then get annoyed by an
					error being thrown. Some ideas to fix that could be to add a css arrow that is pointing down on the
					date after placing in the full card number, or simple words above those spots. The MM/YY CVC feel
					like they run together which is why they can become missed. However, this input field keeps the rest
					of the site's feel and strives for that simple/clean look.</p>
				<img src="img/niftyCCardExampleCode.png"
					 alt="Displayed HTML Code of Credit Card Example"
					 class="note__img--scale">
				<ul>
					<li>First off, the entire input field is it's own separate HTML document</li>
					<li>Which means, this is a document consisting of a form, and an input field that looks like it's
						only one field.</li>
					<li>There are spans used for all the extra features.
						<ul>
							<li>aria support/tabindex for the number</li>
							<li>credit card images</li>
							<li>number field, expiration field, and CVC field, zipcode field 
								<ul>
									<li>All of these provide the nifty text that doesn't disappear on focus</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li> 
					<li>disabled input fields for tabIndex and the general separation of the various fields. These have
						opacity of 0, so they are there, but not.</li>
					<li>The actual makeup of the container is:
						<ul>
							<li>div container &#8407; div card icon; div card fields wrapper; invisible input field;
								invisible button;</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>It is interesting though, the div card fields wrapper includes a fake number div, that includes
						the value you've given. The actual input under the span class="InputContainer" under
						CardNumberField-input-wrapper, acts like it doesn't input anything in, and only sets the
						attribute value of the input. I don't understand the reasoning behind this; is it to hide the
						input field, or make it harder to find?</li>
					<li>Overall, this simple form has a lot more going on than you would think. As most things do, but I
						like how they made the card data seem like it was completely contained on one line. </li>
				</ul>

				<p style="grid-column: span 2;">I'm super curious now as to why they have a whole class set up for a fakeNumber. What's the point? I
					searched through <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/sec-forms.html#sec-forms">W3C:Forms</a> and
					couldn't find any tips on why the extra fake number div. The only thing that seemed kind of familiar
					to their coding style was that W3C suggests the use of surrounding each area within a form with
					div tags. </p>
				<p style="grid-column: span 2">Another idea that I found as to why they have that there is because they are using it as a way to
					send it to the server without having it store itself in jquery. <a
					   href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33228963/how-to-pass-a-div-value-as-input-in-a-form">This
						Stack post</a> suggests (in the second answer) a way to send div data to the server by creating
					a hidden input that's value is set based off of the div. Another user suggested cloning the div
					value, and posting it to the server. <br><br>Both of these ideas don't explain the fake div number class. However, maybe they are using a hidden
					input that's setting the value for the actual input to fetch it to the server. Not sure</p>
