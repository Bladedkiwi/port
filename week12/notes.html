				<h3>Use React of Not</h3>
				<p>What does it take to use and implement React into a project? I did a tutorial the other day showing how to use react as a script src tag. It felt like suddenly, it was easy to use and play with. However, I started another tutorial on React working through various examples and it didn't work. I even morphed them into a similar coding style of the first. After it ultimately failed, I wondered if it had to do with the original src link. Maybe, the package only included details for that tutorial. At this point, I wondered if this was something too out of reach, and not worth my time in the end.</p>
				<p>Today, I decided to give it one last shot. I decided I would give myself an hour to figure out the possiblities of it working. Someone made a detailed post on hosting React without a dedicated server through github, and it seems rather ingenius. Overall, react seems to be similar to how Sass is to CSS. It has to be compiled, and does need some starter things installed.</p>
