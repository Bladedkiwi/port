        <hr>
        <p>9/19/2020, 2:09:12 PM--Mobile First
        <p>Small/Mobile First. Definitely not changing anytime soon or ever. </p>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>9/19/2020, 2:13:15 PM--Keep things light and Quick
        <p>People don't have attention spans anymore, hah! It's sad that this is true. Interesting to make things
            accessible for one handed grip. Key items must be placed in strategic places. Keep web pages light for
            loading speed. -Reduce image usage -SVG/Webfonts are lower bandwidth -Optimize and Minify CSS and JS files
        </p>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>9/19/2020, 2:17:13 PM--Mobile Menus
        <p>Nav bar on bottom for ease of reach for mobile -aids in usability because it's easy to reach Menu with border
            turns out to be the easiest for users to understand. Makes sense. </p>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>9/19/2020, 2:23:53 PM--
        <p>Mobile Forms - -Enable autocomplete for forms -Keep forms simple -ditch the label names -use float labels
            instead -make forms customizable for what the user want to input like phone or email for getting quotes.
            -long forms should be done in pages and show how many more pages needed for completion. I don't agree with
            showing passwords automatically, just my opinion though. I can see the bonus to it. -Space credit card
            information as entered</p>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>9/19/2020, 2:26:56 PM--Stop Pop Ups.
        <p>Popups on mobile are the worst. -ads should be kept simple not invasive -window to show the ad underneath,
            decent idea. </p>
        </p>
