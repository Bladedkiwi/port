                <p>WE LOVE TRAVEL AND ADVENTURE! We first fell in love with TURO while on a trip to Colorado when we
                    picked up a Tesla Model S. So excited about the experience and the ability to rent a dream car, we
                    were hooked. We believe life is about amazing experiences, and want to give you the opportunity to
                    enjoy some of your life adventures with a little help from us.<br><br>
                    We run a successful business together (not related to cars), but the "MR" loves nice cars, so the
                    deal was... You can have the cars you think would be most fun to own, but we have to make some
                    income off them to offset our expenses. This is why we are on TURO. <br><br>
                    We hope you love our cars and the experiences they bring as much as we do, and we hope you treat
                    them like your own, with Love, Care and FUN! <br><br>
