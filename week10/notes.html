		<article class="notebook__note">11/18/2020, 12:22:41 PM--<h2>Fetch/CORS Take 2</h2>
			<div class="note__content">
				<p>While looking at fetch, and a random youtube video's comment section, I ran across a comment saying
					you can make any fetch call anywhere. Then, they provided the code they used to do so:</p>
				<code>fetch('https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/'any-site-name-here')</code>
				<p>I tested this out, and it does bypass any headers that were in place, and allows access to a page
					that would normally require the correct headers. At this point, this seemed odd. CORS is a built in
					system that acts like a user/password login for accessing server data. I decided to look into the
					host site, and pulled up cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com. This pulled up their readme text from github.
					The readme didn't really help me understand what was going on, and so I ventured off to the
					designated github addresses at the bottom of the document. <a
					   href="https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/">Rob--W's github</a></p>
				<p>After reading the Readme, and inspecting their actual code in the src files. I came to the conclusion
					that they get the required headers by a method of trial and error, and a proxy Server</p>
				<pre><code>
/**
* Performs the actual proxy request.
*
* @param req {ServerRequest} Incoming http request
* @param res {ServerResponse} Outgoing (proxied) http request
* @param proxy {HttpProxy}
*/
function proxyRequest(req, res, proxy) {
	var location = req.corsAnywhereRequestState.location;
	req.url = location.path;

	var proxyOptions = {
	changeOrigin: false,
	prependPath: false,
	target: location,
	headers: {
		host: location.host,
	},
	// HACK: Get hold of the proxyReq object, because we need it later.
	// https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/blob/v1.11.1/lib/http-proxy/passes/web-incoming.js#L144
	buffer: {
		pipe: function(proxyReq) {
		var proxyReqOn = proxyReq.on;
		// Intercepts the handler that connects proxyRes to res.
		// https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/blob/v1.11.1/lib/http-proxy/passes/web-incoming.js#L146-L158
		proxyReq.on = function(eventName, listener) {
			if (eventName !== 'response') {
			return proxyReqOn.call(this, eventName, listener);
			}
			return proxyReqOn.call(this, 'response', function(proxyRes) {
			if (onProxyResponse(proxy, proxyReq, proxyRes, req, res)) {
				try {
				listener(proxyRes);
				} catch (err) {
				// Wrap in try-catch because an error could occur:
				// "RangeError: Invalid status code: 0"
				// https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/issues/95
				// https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/issues/1080

				// Forward error (will ultimately emit the 'error' event on our proxy object):
				// https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/blob/v1.11.1/lib/http-proxy/passes/web-incoming.js#L134
				proxyReq.emit('error', err);
				}
			}
			});
		};
		return req.pipe(proxyReq);
		},
	},
	};

	var proxyThroughUrl = req.corsAnywhereRequestState.getProxyForUrl(location.href);
	if (proxyThroughUrl) {
	proxyOptions.target = proxyThroughUrl;
	proxyOptions.toProxy = true;
	// If a proxy URL was set, req.url must be an absolute URL. Then the request will not be sent
	// directly to the proxied URL, but through another proxy.
	req.url = location.href;
	}

	// Start proxying the request
	try {
	proxy.web(req, res, proxyOptions);
	} catch (err) {
	proxy.emit('error', err, req, res);
	}
}
				</code></pre>
				<p>This was the code where I made this assumption. It seems like proxyRequest, makes a "clone" of the
					site they're accessing, and tests the site's response headers and retrieves the required header to
					the request. I wasn't positive on this though, and figured I would look into it further. In general,
					I was curious if this would be a way to easily grab updated info from websites like simple html
					content. However, if I am understanding CORS right, this way would be hacking into things instead of
					acquiring access. So, I wanted to be sure.</p>
				<p>I found a nifty article from <a
					   href="https://medium.com/certik/cors-anywhere-the-dangers-of-misconfigured-third-party-software-df232aae144c">Medium.com</a>
					written by CertiK. They explain in depth that cors-anywhere might be useful, but has a major risk of
					Server-side request forgery. They explain, "<br><br>“Server-side request forgery (also known as
					SSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce the server-side application
					to make HTTP requests to an arbitrary domain of the attacker’s choosing. In typical SSRF examples,
					the attacker might cause the server to make a connection back to itself, or to other web-based
					services within the organization’s infrastructure, or to external third-party systems.”-PortSwigger,
					Web Security Academy"<br><br> They go further into an actual example that points out how
					cors-anywhere can be used to perform such a SSRF attack to retrieve the desired sites' headers. At
					the end of this, they end up being able to gain full (read & write) access to that site. </p>
				<p>Overall, this was very informative on the ways code can sometimes be re-used to become the atom bomb.
					After this article, I decided to find other sources that might confirm these things. Most of them
					weren't this in depth, but did hover around the same ideas of overwriting the usage/purpose of CORS.

		<article class="notebook__note">11/19/2020, 12:04:40 PM--<h2>Google API's: Google Calendar</h2>
			<div class="note__content">
				<p>Started looking into how possible it would be to use the Google Calendar API. I found a blog from a
					Google Developer, that walks through using the API <a
					   href="https://gsuite-developers.googleblog.com/2011/12/using-new-js-library-to-unlock-power-of.html">here</a>.
					Overall, the code looks fairly understandable. Functions for both signing/verifying the user, and
					making a fetch call for grabbing the data. The API call does look different because it makes a call
					to the gapi.client or google api client, but continues a similar format as using fetch.</p>
				<p>In general, in order to use the API, I would have to submit my app for use with sensitive scopes(a
					process of having google say your app is approved/okay to do this), or try the G-suite free trial
					that allows developers, or organizations to use the API's among their organization. My guess is that
					I will need to figure out what kind of access I would need. The sensitive scope/OAuth deals with
					logging people into their google calendar and changing their calendar. </p>
				<h3>Understanding what I want</h3>
				<p>Essentially, I want a calendar that allows for sign-ups/paying for that rental time. It is stored on
					one calendar for the company, so they know what cars are being used and when. Also, it has to update
					itself if there's a cancellation. The user can either see the calendar with times taken/available
					with no user info attached, or request a time and set it up that way. It would be easiest, if like
					booking a cabin for example, the taken time slots are shown to the user so they don't become
					frustrated with not getting their time slot. The other caveat is allowing for customizable time
					slots, so renting for 1hr to 8hr30min. <br><br>Well, if we want it to be customizable and be able to
					see the other scheduled times taken that can be easy. Show the calendar with times taken (invisible
					user info), and then allow the user to set it up themselves. Also, there could be a built in system
					where there is a buffer zone like 15min between rentals for cleaning. So, base functionality, I
					would need access to the company calendar to edit/view. Enhanced functionality, would be to offer an
					option to set the user's reserved time in their own calendar too. </p>
				<p>Overall, I imagine I will need OAuthorization abilities for the company's calendar. Something to
					continue researching though. </p>

		<article class="notebook__note">11/21/2020, 12:35:18 PM--<h2>Quick Look: React</h2>
			<div class="note__content">
				<p><a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#overview">React</a> is a declarative, efficient,
					and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This allows the creation of complex
					User Interfaces, and the creation of isolated pieces of code called "components". This code simply
					displays this Shopping list, but is customizable. Much like a string literal, render() returns a
					React element.</p>
				<pre><code>
class ShoppingList extends React.Component {
	render() {
	return (
		div className="shopping-list"
		h1 Shopping List for {this.props.name} h1
		ul
			li Instagram li
			li WhatsApp li
			li Oculus li
		ul
		div
	);
	}
}

// Example usage: ShoppingList name="Mark" 
		</code></pre>
				<pre><code>
					
return React.createElement('div', {className: 'shopping-list'},
	React.createElement('h1', /* ... h1 children ... */),
	React.createElement('ul', /* ... ul children ... */)
);
			</code></pre>
					<p>This snippet, is equivalent to the above. Essentially, react grabs the shopping list, and throws
						the content inside a div-h1-ul combo.</p>
