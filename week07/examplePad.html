            <h3>Closure()</h3>
            <p>Curious why closure() is one of JavaScript's most powerful features, and why they would be difficult to
                understand. Time to test it out, and understand what's going on with them. Why are they special?
                Examples from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures">MDN</a></p>
            <p>From what I've understood, closure() enables access to variables that aren't in scope anymore, and allow
                for use of the function after it has already been invoked. However, why is that any different than
                simply calling the function again to invoke it?</p>
            <pre><code>
function closure() {
    const a = 1.8;
    const b = 32;
    return c => c * a + b;
}
const toFahrenheit = closure();
toFahrenheit(30);
            </code></pre>
            <p>Running the code:</p>
            <code class="ex1"></code>
            <p>What occured above was that we created a function for getting fahrenheit. Generally, the use of using a
                parameter to make that function would be considered for using it again. That's not what was done though,
                and in fact a function was placed inside a function to get the result. Now, with the function not
                requiring any parameters, we might wonder what 30 is even doing. Essentially, we made a function that is
                the recipe for getting fahrenheit. The return is a function, and the 30 gets passed into the c there and
                calculates there. Values a and b are still the same, and aren't redefined but just kept alive.</p>
            <pre><code>
function makeAdder(x) {
    return function(y) {
        return x + y;
    };
    }
    
    let add5 = makeAdder(5);
    let add10 = makeAdder(10);
    
    output.innerHTML = add5(2);  // 7
    output.innerHTML += add10(2); // 12
    out2.innerHTML += add200(4); // 204
            </code></pre>
            <p>Running the code:</p>
            <code class="ex2"></code>
            <p>This is exciting. We started the 'recipe' function, and now we have a versatile function to add numbers
                and set numbers easily. So, the question has come up, do we really need to save an extra variable for
                creating x, or can we do it all in one go? <em>Closure Scope Chain</em> is the process of going through
                the scope levels of the closure function. For each "(#)" we have after makeAdder, the scope chain
                assigns the x and y.</p>
            <pre><code>
out3.innerHTML += makeAdder(2140)(10000);
            </code></pre>
            <p>Running the code:</p>
            <code class="ex3"></code>
            <p>The next question coming to mind, is how can this help aide trivial tasks. With these example codes, each
                one has a different class attached to it. Writing out document.querySelector over and over can get
                tiring. With the idea of a counter closure function combined with a setter of the item, this is how I
                solved this trivial task. It's rather entertaing:</p>
            <pre><code>
function counter(start) {
    let i = start;
    return function () {
        return i++;
    }
}
function setOut() {
    let num = counter(1);
    return function (item) {
        return item = document.querySelector(`.ex${num()}`)
    }
}
const out = setOut();
let out1 = out(out);
let out2 = out(out1);
let out3 = out(out2);
            </code></pre>
            <p>This is great, and extremely simple to keep up. out1 is created from out and it's implementation, and
                uses the first counter it made. The method is to use the variable before it to continue the easy
                designation of output.</p>

        function counter(start) {
            let i = start;
            return function () {
                return i++;
            }
        }

        function setOut() {
            let num = counter(1);
            return function (item) {
                return item = document.querySelector(`.ex${num()}`)
            }
        }
        const out = setOut();
        let out1 = out(out);
        let out2 = out(out1);
        let out3 = out(out2);

        function closure() {
            const a = 1.8;
            const b = 32;
            return c => c * a + b;
        }
        const toFahrenheit = closure();
        out1.innerHTML = toFahrenheit(30);


        function makeAdder(x) {
            return function (y) {
                return x + y;
